# Requirements
When the user clicks the "Add Number" button, the number they entered into the input field should be added to the number bank.
The number bank is not changed if the user enters a non-numeric value.
The number bank should display all the numbers the user has entered.
When the "Sort 1" button is clicked, the first number in the number bank should be removed and placed into either the odd or even category.
When the "Sort All" button is clicked, all the numbers in the number bank should be moved into either the odd or even category.
The numbers are placed into the correct bucket based on whether they are odd or even.
