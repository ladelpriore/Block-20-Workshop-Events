Workshop - Odds and Events
In this workshop, you'll continue to get more practice working with events and event handlers. The goal is to create an app that allows a user to enter a number which gets placed into a number bank. The user can then sort the numbers in the bank into one of two categories: odd or even.

Preview of the app: a user types 9 into the input field and clicks a button to add it to a number bank. The user then clicks the "Sort 1" button. The 9 is moved from the number bank into the "odd" category.
